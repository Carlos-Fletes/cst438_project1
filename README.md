#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My role was getting the base project ready, setting up the login, setting up database for users and user info.
+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + The biggest challenge was getting both databases to work together and have the userId be sent to the comic database to save the user data.
+Why was it a challenge?
  + It was a challenge as it was my first time making two local databases connect to each other and save that info.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + I had to look up help for fixing the issue geeksforgeeks was a great source for not only understanding foreign keys but getting them to work.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + My favorite part of the project was getting it to run as intended and seeing the database work. 
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + If I could do it over one thing I would change would be asking for help on the database sooner so it would be set up sooner. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + The most valuable thing I learned here was how important it is to have a plan and schedule to get things done.
