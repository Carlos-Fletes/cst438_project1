#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My role was getting the base project ready, setting up the login, setting up the database for users, and user info.
+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + The biggest challenge was getting both databases to work together and have the userId be sent to the comic database to save the user data.
+Why was it a challenge?
  + It was a challenge as it was my first time making two local databases connect to each other and save that info.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + I had to look up help for fixing the issue geeksforgeeks was a great source for not only understanding foreign keys but getting them to work.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + My favorite part of the project was getting it to run as intended and seeing the database work. 
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + If I could do it over one thing I would change would be asking for help on the database sooner so it would be set up sooner. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + The most valuable thing I learned here was how important it is to have a plan and schedule to get things done.

## Conclusion
I think the project was successful in the barebones of the project. We got about half of the issues we listed done and got it looking and usable to a reasonable degree. The largest victory was being able to get everybody elses work to work together with minimal errors. In all I think the project turned out well but could've been better and more fleshed out.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
  + My role was working on the front end and getting the project to look good while maintaining its core features.
+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + My laptop has not been booting my emulator recently and it's been my biggest challenge to understand how to work this project and get the program and laptop to work.
+Why was it a challenge?
  + It was very challenging to change the program without seeing my changes in real time.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + I worked with the TA, Roberto, to sort the issue, but it was tiresome and complicated. I made several file changes, deleted and reinstalled Android Studio, and still, no progress was made. So instead of wasting time, I bought a new laptop and plan to be better prepared with better hardware for this class.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + I loved making front-end changes and seeing how the result worked. My favorite part was making the home page, as it dealt with a lot of unfamiliar grounds for me, but making all the changes I did made me feel better about this app.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would choose to understand the changes made by my teammates and understand the code they need help with so we can overcome these problems faster and more efficiently. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + I learned the process of teamwork; it was great to finally understand GitHub and work with a team that could pull its own weight.

## Conclusion
This project was a rough road, but as seen by the changes and commits from each member here, it all worked out fine. I liked the progress we made, but it did feel sloppy, and I felt as though our project lacked in certain areas. I also believe that I could do more and learn more from this project. I want to be more involved next time. I also want to better communicate, as I felt like there was sometimes a lack of communication and direction. Overall, I believed that as the first project, everyone did what they could, but I strive to achieve more next time and learn more backend next time around.
